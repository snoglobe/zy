# zy
This is the reference implementation of the zy programming language, written in Kotlin.
It's naive, quite unoptimized and quite slow. It's main purpose is to tide the project over
until a faster, smarter interpreter can be written. This is more of a PoC, although it is
quite usable if you're not doing anything that requires performance.
